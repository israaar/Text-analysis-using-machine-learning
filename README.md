# Text-analysis-using-machine-learning
Translate wiki pages(German to English) using statistical machine translation. I want to learn how to align the parallel corpus after making a csv or tsv file dataset using Giza++ in python, and then use bayes rule to find the best translation to the sentences in English to German.
